**If you find it worth it , feel free to give this repo a star⭐⭐**
**See the application in action and test it yourself !! Deployment Link-  https://shop-now-megu-community.netlify.app/**

This is a E-commerce website build on React.js at the frontend and all the backend is handled by Commerce.js(A powerful eCommerce SDK for building custom cart and checkout experiences. Commerce.js is trusted by developers around the world to deliver API driven eCommerce into web, mobile, augmented, and virtual shopping experiences).
It uses react-hook-form package to create custom forms and material-ui for the styling, react-credit-card-input package to create the credit card input fields.I have integrated the testing payment gateway provided by commerce.js in the application. 

**Version 2.0💡 has customer authorization via magic links to make the protected routes only be accessible if the customer is logged in and the authorization system is implemented by the use of magic links sent to the email address of the customer**

**The testing card details provided by commerce.js is
4242 4242 4242 4242   04 / 24  242
Putting in any other card number will lead u to the error page ❌ displaying a error message along with a button leading u back to the store.**

Updated App Flow-

1. The user lands on the login page->enters email id->magic link sent confirmatory message-> magic link sent received on the email.

**After clicking on the magic link recieved the customer will be redirected to a new tab and will be able to access the protected routes(Do shopping after authorization). A sample of the magic link email can be found in the repo as-> Magic Link Email Sample.pdf**

2. The user lands on the landing Page

As I said I am back with authorization 💥 (Earlier: -I haven't implemented the login and logout functionality yet but i m gonna get that thing here in the future commits 😅)




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
